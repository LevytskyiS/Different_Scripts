# Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.

# Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.

# Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).

# Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.

# Python accepts the control-L (i.e. ^L) form feed character as whitespace; many tools treat these characters as page separators, so you may use them to separate pages of related sections of your file. Note, some editors and web-based code viewers may not recognize control-L as a form feed and will show another glyph in its place.
